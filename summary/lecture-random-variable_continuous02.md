# Random Variables and Probability Functions (Continuous Variables: Part II)

## Detailed Topics to be covered

## Motivation

1. What is the issue when we study a continuous variable? Why is it different from a discrete variable? 
2. What are the possible solutions?

## Approach 2. Parameters or Parts of the Distribution (Mean)

1. A Brief Hisotrical Account of **mean**
2. Formal Definition of **Population Mean** or **Expectation**, and how to use it. 
3. Three Properties of Expectation Operator
4. Applications of mean in contemporary decision analysis

    1. Criterion of Expected Value Maximization

5. How to obtain **mean**? **Sample Averages**

    1. Weighted Version of Sample Averages
    2. Probability Weighted Version of Sample Averages
    
6. Limitations of Mean
7. Applications of mean in social science: Good ones vs Bad ones.
