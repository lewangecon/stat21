title: "Value at Risk (VaR): A worked Example"

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook that illustrates how to calculate Value at Risk (VaR), an important statistic for financial risk management. 

## Basics

Lets download the data first

```{r}
library("quantmod")

# Download Walmart stock data from Yahoo
getSymbols('WMT')

# Take a look at the data (first six rows/dates)
head(WMT)  
```

We are not interested in the prices itself. Instead, we are interested in **returns to stocks**

```{r}
# Calculate Daily Return
# return = log(S[i]/S[i-1])

#ret <- diff(log(WMT$WMT.Adjusted))
ret <- diff(WMT$WMT.Adjusted)/lag(WMT$WMT.Adjusted)
head(ret)

ret2 <- dailyReturn(WMT$WMT.Adjusted)
head(ret2)
```

From now on, I would like to focus on the daily returns, `ret`, that I construct. Let's look at the VaR for daily returns

```{r}
z <- c(0:15)/100
plot(density(ret,na.rm = TRUE))
abline(v=quantile(ret,0.05, type = 1,na.rm=TRUE),col="red",lty=1)
```

We can calculate the quantile of the distribution of the returns to this stock, i.e., (VaR for **daily returns**)

```{r}
quantile(ret,0.05, type = 1,na.rm=TRUE)
```


Let's set parameters $\alpha$ and the amount of investment value $V$

```{r}
V = 1000
alpha<-0.05
```


Calculate the VaR for any specified $\alpha$. 

```{r}
quantile(ret,alpha, type = 1,na.rm=TRUE)
```

Then, the VaR for the **amount of investment**, $V$ is 

```{r}
V*quantile(ret,alpha, type = 1,na.rm=TRUE)
```

**Interpretation:** there is a 5\% chance that we will lose **more than** `r V*quantile(ret,0.05, type = 1,na.rm=TRUE)` on our 1000 dollar investment in the next day.

## Extensions

### Subsets

Lets say that we would like to consider only a specific time period for our anlaysis. 

```{r}
WMT.2011<-subset(ret2,index(ret2) >="2011-01-01" & index(ret2) <="2011-12-31")
head(WMT.2011)
tail(WMT.2011)


V*quantile(WMT.2011,alpha, type = 1,na.rm=TRUE)
```

### Different horizons

In industry, people also use the Square Root of $T$ rule to scale 1-day VaR to a $T-day$ VaR. For example, 7 day VaR would be:

```{r}
days <- 7
sqrt(days)*V*quantile(ret,alpha, type = 1,na.rm=TRUE)
```


Or, one-month VaR would be

```{r}
days <- 30
sqrt(days)*V*quantile(ret,alpha, type = 1,na.rm=TRUE)
```
