This is an R Mardown Notebook that will walk you through ann important concept for **continuous variables**: quantile.

## Quantiles

Lets simulate the data


```{r}
x<-c(6,7,6,3,10,3,2,1,10,7)
```




We can calculate the median

```{r}
median(x)
```

We calculate the $40^{th}$ percentile
```{r}
quantile(x,.4)
```

But this is really not the type of definition.
```{r}
quantile(x,.8, type = 1)
```

```{r}
quantile(x, probs = seq(0,1,0.01)    ,type = 1)
plot(seq(0,1,0.01), quantile(x, probs = seq(0,1,0.01)    ,type = 1))
```
