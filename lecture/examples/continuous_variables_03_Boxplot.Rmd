This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook that illustrates how to plot box plots to get a complete view of the distribtion in one graph. 

Lets work on an artificial data

```{r}
set.seed(123456)
box.data <-rnorm(100)
box.data
```

Take a look at the distribution of the variable
```{r}
summary(box.data)
```


We an plot all the information

```{r}
boxplot(box.data)
```


1. The **top** and **bottom** lines of the rectangle are the **3rd** and **1st quartiles** (Q3 and Q1), respectively.  The length of the rectangle is the IQR.
2. The line in the middle of the rectangle is the **median**.
3. The top whisker denotes the maximum value or the 3rd quartile plus 1.5 times the interquartile range (Q3 + 1.5*IQR), whichever is smaller.
4. The bottom whisker denotes either the minimum value or the 1st quartile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range (Q1 - 1.5*IQR), whichever is larger.


```{r}
data <- data.frame(x = 1, y = box.data)

ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  xlim(c(0,2))
```


If you have a dataset, you can also use the following trick

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = 1, y = depth))
```
