# Roadmap

1. Data types in Base `R`
2. Data Frames
3. Tibbles in `tidyverse`, and data types in this world
4. Data tables

# Data types in Base `R`

Here we discuss various types of data in `R`. `R` works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:

	1. **Decimal values** like 4.5 are called numerics.
	2. **Natural numbers** like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
	3. **Boolean values** (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
	4. **Text** (or string) values are called characters.

Note how the quotation marks on the right indicate that "some text" is a character. You can check the type of data by using `class()`. For example, we had the variable x above

```{r}
  x <- "Melody to Funkytown!"
  class(x)
```


```{r}
    x <- c("TRUE", "FALSE")
    class(x)
    x <- as.logical(x)
    class(x)

    x <- 1:20
    x %% 4 
    x %% 4 == 0
    class(x %% 4 == 0)
```


# A collection of data points

## Vectors  	

You can think of an vector as an indexed list of drawers. 

### Some basic examples 

```{r}
v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)		
v
v <- 1:4		
v
v <- seq(from = 0, to = 0.5, by = 0.1)		
v


#Vectors with strings 	
v_colors <- c("blue", "yellow", "light green")	
v_colors	

```

Here `c()` stands for **concatenate** or **combine**. 


### Vector selection (Indexing/reassigning elements)

```{r}
v_colors[2]         
v_colors[c(1, 3)]   

v_colors[2:3]  <- c("red", "purple")	
v_colors 	

x <- 100:110
x
j <- c(-1,-2,-3)
x[j]
```


# We can do it with logical expressions as well

```{r}
x <- 100:110
x >105
select <- x>105

x[x>105]
```


See [Datacamp course](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) for other ways to subset a vector


### Names of a vector

```{r}
names(v_colors) <- c("Le", "Austin", "Heather")
```

### Algebraic Operations of Vectors

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3)
y <- c(4,5,6)

# component-wise addition
x+y

# component-wise multiplication
x*y

# What happens to the following
y^x
```


### Repeating Vector in `R`

```{r}
# Would this work?
c(1,2,3,4) + c(1,2)

# Would this work?
c(1,2,3) + c(1,2)
```

The reason is that when you are adding vectors of unequal size, if the long one is a multiple of the short one, `R` automatically repeats the short one to fill in the operation. For example, $2$ is the short one and $(1,2,3)$ the long one

```{r}
2*c(1,2,3)
```

### Vector 

In the [Datacamp course](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) you will learn other operations of vectors.


## Matrix

### create a new matrix
```{r}
matrix<-matrix(1:4, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2)
matrix
```

Note that `:` means every number from 1 to 4. In the `matrix()` function:

    1. The first argument is the collection of elements that `R` will arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix. Here, we use 1:4 which is a shortcut for c(1, 2, 3, 4).
    2. The argument `byrow` indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows. If we want the matrix to be filled by the columns, we just place `byrow = FALSE`.
    3. The third argument `nrow` indicates that the matrix should have three rows.	

### Selection of Matrix Elements

```{r}
matrix[1,2]
matrix[,1:2]
```


### rename a matrix

```{r}
	rownames(matrix) <- c("Le", "Chen")
	colnames(matrix) <- c("Yes", "No")
	
	matrix
```

### Dimension of a matrix vs vector

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3)
matrix<-matrix(1:4, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2)
matrix


length(x)
length(matrix)


dim(matrix)
dim(x)
```

### Algebraic Operation

You will be asked to find commands on your own and use them to perform such operations in your homework.

## Lists

`R` doesn’t like vectors to have different types: `c(TRUE, 1, "Frank")` becomes `c("TRUE", "1", "Frank")`. But storing objects with different types is absolutely fundamental to data analysis. `R` has a different type of object besides a vector used to store data of different types side-by-side: a list:

```{r}
c(TRUE, 1, "Frank")
```


```{r}
x <- list(TRUE, 1, "Frank")
x
```

Many different things not necessarily of same length can be put together. 

```{r}
x <- list(c(1:5), c("a", "b","c"), c(TRUE, FALSE), c(5L, 6L))
```

### Example: Imagine Manipulation 

Image files are inherently matrices, since the pixels are arranged in rows and columns. If we have a grayscale image, for each pixel, we store the *intensity* -- brightness -- of hte image at that pixel. For a color image, three matrices are stored, with intensities for red, green, and blue components. 

The following example is taken from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imager/vignettes/gettingstarted.html). If you have an issue installing and loading the following package, it may be due to X11. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50398836/rstudio-wont-allow-me-to-install-the-package-imager) for a solution. 

Note the y axis running downwards: the origin is at the top-left corner, which is the traditional coordinate system for images. imager uses this coordinate system consistently.

```{r}
#install.packages("imager")
library(imager)
plot(boats)
```

```{r}
# Note that four dimensions since it is a color picture
dim(boats)

# What are these dimensions?
# height, width, depth , color
# if depth is greater than 1, then this is really a video.
boats

# let me convert it to a grayscale picture instead

myboats <-  grayscale(boats)
dim(myboats)
```

```{r}
plot(myboats)
```


Now lets manipulate this picture
```{r}
myboats[100:130, 140:190,1,1] <- 1
plot(myboats)
```

	
## Dataframe

### What's a data frame? (special case of list: equal length)

Our data often contain various types of data or variables. For example, in the CPS data that you will 
be dealing with, you will have information on income (numeric), gender (logical), race (string)
A data frame can have many types of data, and each variable is treated as columns and 
the observations (or units) as rows. 


### Why use data.frames?

    1. data.frames - unlike general arrays or, specifically, matrices in R - can hold variables of different flavors (heuristic term defined later), such as character data (subject ID or name), quantitative data (white blood cell count), and categorical information (treated vs. untreated)
    2. data.frames package related variables neatly together,keeping them in sync vis-a-vis row order applying any filtering of observations uniformly
    3. Most functions for inference, modelling, and graphing are happy to be passed a data.frame via a data =?argument as the place to find the variables you're working on; the latest and greatest packages actually?require?that your data be in a data.frame



### Create a data frame

Data frame with Harry Potter characters

```{r}
	name <- c("Harry", "Ron", "Hermione", "Hagrid", "Voldemort")	
	height <- c(176, 175, 167, 230, 180)	
	gpa <- c(3.4, 2.8, 4.0, 2.2, 3.4)	
	df_students <- data.frame(name, height, gpa)  		
	df_students	
```


Alternative way of creating DF

```{r}
	df_students <- data.frame(name = c("Harry", "Ron", "Hermione", "Hagrid",
					   "Voldemort"), 	
				  height = c(176, 175, 167, 230, 180), 	
				  gpa = c(3.4, 2.8, 4.0, 2.2, 3.4))	
	df_students

```


	
	
### Adding variable

```{r}
	df_students$good <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 0)   	
	df_students	
```


### Features of the DF

```{r}
	dim(df_students)  		
	df_students[2, 3]               #Ron's GPA		
	df_students$gpa[2]              #Ron's GPA	

	df_students[5, ]                #get row 5
	df_students[3:5, ]              #get rows 3-5

	df_students[, 2]                #get column 2 (height)	
	df_students$height              #get column 2 (height) 
	df_students[, 1:3]              #get columns 1-3 


	df_students[4, 2] <- 255        #reassign Hagrid's height	
	df_students$height[4] <- 255    #same thing as above	
	df_students		
```

## Tibble in Tidyverse

**Tibbles** are `data.frame`!, but they tewak some older behaviors to make life a little easier. And they are one of the unifying features of the `tidyverse`.

Chapter 10 of **R for Data Science**

Several benefits of `tibble` as follows

1. refined printing method
2. never changes in the input. Does not treat string as factors
3. allows for nonsyntatic names (not valid under base R).

First you can coerce any data frames to be a tibble

```{r}
as.tibble(iris)
```

Second, we can create one as follows

```{r}
tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)
```

Third, we can create crazy names with backticks like follows

```{r}
tb <- tibble(
  `:)` = "smile", 
  ` ` = "space",
  `2000` = "number"
)
tb
```

Finally, we can create one using clearer code `tribble` (transposed tibble)

```{r}
tribble(
  ~x, ~y, ~z,
  #--|--|----
  "a", 2, 3.6,
  "b", 1, 8.5
)
```


## Data.table

`data.table` is an R package that provides an enhanced version of `data.frames`. Its introduction is available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html)
